Adoptapedia
===========
DESCRIPTION: This is the program I use to update the deviantArt adoptable group I run called Adoptapedia (found at adoptapedia.deviantart.com). It contains a directory of adoptable groups that have been sorted into categories so artists can submit their art to several groups within a genre.

History
===========
Past incarnations were written in Java and C++. The program is being currently rewritten in Python.
